# Introduction and Goals {#section-introduction-and-goals}
This document describes the architecture for the Climate Service designed for the I-CISK project.

## Requirements Overview {#_requirements_overview}
The Climate Service for the I-CISK project aims to fulfill the following goals:

- provide access to environmental data both from *external* services (e.g. from the Copernicus Program [], the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) []) as well as a variety of local data sources;

- integrate analysis chains for indicator calculations which are developed in I-CISK WP3 and WP4,

- provide visualisation tools for the indicators;

- provide stakeholders with the possibility to easily extend the existing functionality by modifying and adding individual components as well as setting up a new CS with a dedicated AUTO CS Composer

## Summary of stakeholder requirements for each Living Lab {#_stakeholders}
This  section summarises the current status of the properties that have been identified as necessary for the individual CS components by the LL leaders. Thereby, the requirements for the back-end are collected separately from those for the front-end. The individual components that are considered for the **back end** are the

- Climate Data Hindcast/Forecast Providers (the external data recources excluding local recources)

- Local Data Knowledge ECV (the local data recources)

- EVC/Indicators (the target variables)

- Data Types (the data types of the indicators)

- Time Scenario (the time periods over which the indicators are aggregated)

- Climate Models (models necessary to obtain the target indicators)

- Climate Adaption/Economic Models (models which investigate the climate response of indicators to adaption strategies)

- Run Mode of Climate Model and Adaption/Economic models (the run mode of climate and adaption models)

- Climate Model and Adaption/Economic Model Providers (external services or I-CISK WPs that provide the models) <br>


On the other hand, the components which are relevant for the **front end** are the

- Visualisation Containers 

- Visualisation Tools

- Visualisation Tool Providers

- Web Service <br>

# Architecture Constraints {#section-architecture-constraints}
The CS software needs to meet the following constraints:

- since the final CS will be an open-access platform, the CS framework should only apply open-source software

- to assure interoperability of data and models, the CS framework will implement OGC standards and follow the INSPIRE implementing rules


#
# System Scope and Technical Context {#section-system-scope-and-context}

Figure 1 shows the major interfaces of the CS architecture to the CS user as well as external model providers and data recources. The user will be able to access the CS via a graphical user interface (GUI) and a REST-API. Due to the large variaty with respect to the developement stages of the individuel components, the communication protocols between the CS and the external components are so far only defined for some cases. The communication protocols for the other components will be characterised in the further course of the I-CISK project. For the components which are already more advanced, the communication protocols are indicated in Figure 1 and they are listed in Table X together with the corresponding providers.

# Solution Strategy {#section-solution-strategy}

- run everything in a cluster -> have flexible computation recources
- wrap everything in a docker container -> dependency management ...

# Building Block View {#section-building-block-view}

## Whitebox Overall System {#_whitebox_overall_system}
Going into more detail about the CS architecture, Figure X illustrates the Level 1 components. All these components will be deployed in an XXX cloud []. The major responsibilities of the corresponding building blocks are

- **GeoNode web framework**: GeoNode is a web framework that provides basic functionalities for the developement of spatial data infrastructures based on open sources software []. For the CS platform, the available features will be extended and modified according to the architecture requirements. <br>
The major repsonsibilities of the GeoNode module include the visualisation of climate indicators via a GUI on the one hand and the provision of an access point to I-CISK web map services and data recources via an REST-API on the other hand. Internally, the GeoNode REST-API implements the communication interface between the Data Analysis Tool and the data storage components. The GeoNode web service also contributes with data  and task management tools.

- **WP3 visualisation toolbox**: The visualisation examples developed by WP3 of the I-CISK project will be integrated in the GeoNode GUI. (?)

- **Internal local data**: For serveral LLs (e.g. Italy), local data will be uploaded manually to the CS platform and will be stored on internal capacities.

- **Data Analysis Tool**: The calculation of the climate indicators is performed in the Data Analysis Tool. Necessary calculations steps include bias correction and downscaling procedures. Whereas for some indicators the respective models will run as components within the I-CISK platform, the estimation of other parameters requires the connection of external models.
#
Do we need to also define the interfaces already?

## Level 2 {#_level_2}

### White Box GeoNode web framework {#_white_box_emphasis_building_block_1_emphasis}

#
The GeoNode web framework is built from various components of which some are mandadory and some can be used on demand. Figure XXX shows the decomposition of the GeoNode components that will be used for the I-CISK platform. These components have the following responsibilities:

- **GUI**: The GUI enables the CS user to request the calculation and visualisation of particular indicators. It allows for interactive adjustment of calculation constraints. For example, it allows the user to change the time period over which data is aggregated for a selection of indicators with a slider or similar. The GUI also comes with a toolbox that enables the user to autonomously compose dedicated CS by combining different analysis procedures and data sets.

- **REST-API**: The REST-API provides an access point for external services to services and data sets of the CS framework.

- **Internal local data**: Local data that will be uploaded manually to the CS platform will be stored in a PostgreSQL data base in case of vector data and in the file system in  case of raster data. Also, meta data will be stored in the PostgreSQL data base.

- **Task Manager**: Tasks that need to be executed on a regular basis, e.g. the update of local data recources, can be scheduled in GeoNode using a combination of Celery and RabbitQM. Whereas Celery organises the task queue and task Â´excecution, RabbitQM constitutes the message broker. 

- **GeoServer**:  The calculation results will be published by GeoServer which implements OGC standards.

- **Data Ingestor**: The data ingestor component will read the data from the various recources and bring it into a format that is suitable for the data analysis. It adjusts the meta data to the OGC standards and ? transforms it into netCDF files? 

- **Data Catalogue**: GeoNode provides a data catalogue in which data is registered with the appropriate meta data. The metadata is generated from a Django relation database and published via pycsw.
