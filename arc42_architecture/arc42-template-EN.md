# Introduction and Goals {#section-introduction-and-goals}
This document describes the architecture for the Climate Service designed for the I-CISK project.

## Requirements Overview {#_requirements_overview}
The Climate Service for the I-CISK project aims to fulfill the following goals:

- provide access to a combination of different sources for environmental data e.g. from the Copernicus Program [], the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) [] and, in particular, a variety of local data sources;

- integrate models for bias correction, downscaling and indicator calculation;

- provide visualisation tools for the indicators that are required by the individual LLs;

- provide stakeholders with the possibility to easily extend the existing functionality by modifying and adding individual components.

## Quality Goals {#_quality_goals}

- comprehensive visualisation techniques that are adapted to the stakeholders needs

- modular integration of models and data sources such that individual components can be combined for the calculation of different indicators in a flexible way
- easy operation and comprehensive documentation of software components to enable stakeholders to further extend the CS also after the project duration

## Summary of stakeholder requirements for each Living Lab {#_stakeholders}
This  section summarises the current status of the properties that have been identified as necessary for the individual CS components by the LL leaders. Thereby, the requirements for the back end are collected separately from those for the front end. The individual components that are considered for the back end are the

- Climate Data Hindcast/Forecast Providers (the external data recources excluding local recources)

- Local Data Knowledge ECV (the local data recources)

- EVC/Indicators (the target variables)

- Data Types (the data types of the indicators)

- Time Scenario (the time periods over which the indicators are aggregated)

- Climate Models (models necessary to obtain the target indicators)

- Climate Adaption/Economic Models (models which investigate the climate response of indicators to adaption strategies)

- Run Mode of Climate Model and Adaption/Economic models (the run mode of climate and adaption models)

- Climate Model and Adaption/Economic Model Providers (external services or I-CISK WPs that provide the models) <br>

- Visualisation Tools

- Visualisation Tool Providers

- Web Service <br>
